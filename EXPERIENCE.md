Tool Selection Justification
I chose Cursor for this project because of its deep integration with the VS Code ecosystem, which I am already familiar with. Its ability to index the entire codebase and provide "Composer" mode for multi-file edits makes it a premier example of a "vibe coding" tool. For a Python-based GUI application, I needed a tool that could handle both logic and visual layout simultaneously.

Development Process
The development was extremely rapid. I used a single "Master Prompt" to describe the features (Add/Delete/Persist) and the desired aesthetic (Modern UI).

Prompting: I used the Composer feature (Ctrl + I) to generate the project structure.

Iteration: It took only one major iteration to get a working prototype. Cursor automatically generated the main.py, a requirements.txt, and even a README.md without me asking for them separately.

Challenges and Solutions
One minor challenge was ensuring all dependencies were correctly mapped. However, Cursor anticipated this by generating a requirements.txt file automatically. I also had to install the Python extension for the editor to recognize the environment, which was prompted by the IDE itself. The AI-driven workflow eliminated the need for manual boilerplate coding for the Tkinter GUI.

Reflection
What surprised me most about "vibe coding" was the proactive nature of the tool. It didn't just wait for me to write code; it suggested a complete project structure based on a high-level description.

Impact: This technology shifts the role of a developer from "syntax writer" to "system architect."

Future Use: I would definitely use Cursor for future projects, especially for prototyping and building MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features where speed and context are critical.
